19. Try to use images as much as you can relating to the topic when you respond. For every exercise, put images for each different exercise.

20. If the exercises has variants, you can put these images above instead. For example, for walking lunges, you can use the image of the lunges. In addition if the keyword is not plural, you can assume it to be plural. For example, squat is also squats.

21. Make sure exeercises or food with images appear first, then have the other exercises or food with no images appear after. Designate that there is no picture for them.

22. Return titles like this <h3>{title}</h3>
